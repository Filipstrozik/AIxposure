```sh
Loading the text and image classification models...
Models loaded successfully!
Welcome to the 'AIxposure' application!
This application allows you to take a screenshot and analyze it using AI models to detect AI-generated and human-written content.
--------------------------------------------
Press the following shortcuts to take a screenshot:
Press <ctrl>+<shift>+s to take a screenshot of both text and image
Press <ctrl>+<shift>+t to take a screenshot of only text
Press <ctrl>+<shift>+i to take a screenshot of only image
Press <ctrl>+<esc> to quit the program
```

## Shortcuts

Use the following shortcuts to take screenshots and analyze content for AI generation:

- **CTRL + SHIFT + S**: Detect both text and image to determine if they are AI-generated.
- **CTRL + SHIFT + T**: Detect only text to determine if it is AI-generated.
- **CTRL + SHIFT + I**: Detect only images to determine if they are AI-generated.
- **CTRL + ESC**: Quit the program.
